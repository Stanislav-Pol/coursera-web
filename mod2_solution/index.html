          <p>The blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) is a species of requiem shark, 
            and part of the family Carcharhinidae. It is common to coastal tropical and 
            subtropical waters around the world, including brackish habitats. 
            The blacktip shark has a stout, fusiform body with a pointed snout, long gill 
            slits, and no ridge between the dorsal fins. Most individuals have black tips 
            or edges on the pectoral, dorsal, pelvic, and caudal fins. It usually attains 
            a length of 1.5 m (4.9 ft).

          <p>The silvertip shark (Carcharhinus albimarginatus) is a large species of requiem 
            shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, with a fragmented distribution throughout 
            the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is often encountered around offshore 
            islands and coral reefs, and has been known to dive to a depth of 800 m (2,600 ft). 
            The silvertip shark resembles a larger and bulkier grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos), 
            but can be easily identified by the prominent white margins on its fins. It attains 
            a maximum length of 3 m (10 ft).

          <p>Additional info. Sharks are very gracious, powerful apex predator. The silvertip 
            shark feeds 
            on a wide variety of bony fishes, as well as eagle rays, smaller sharks, and 
            cephalopods. This species dominates other requiem sharks of equal size when 
            competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from 
            conflicts with others of its species.
